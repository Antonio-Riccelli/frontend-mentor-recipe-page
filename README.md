## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My main learning this time was using a preprocessor like SASS. It was not necessary for the project, and these days CSS has many of its features, but I wanted specifically to learn to implement a preprocessor.

### Continued development

Preprocessors, responsiveness, typography, design (e.g., colour palettes etc.);
